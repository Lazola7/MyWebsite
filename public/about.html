    <section id="company-overview">
        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Phakathi Solutions is a black-owned, B-BBEE Level 1 industrial technology provider
            committed to transforming industries across Africa and beyond. Guided by our mission to
            revolutionise industrial operations through innovative, data-driven solutions, we integrate
            state-of-the-art fabrication services with cutting-edge digital technologies. Our
            comprehensive offerings cover the entire project lifecycle—from design to implementation
            and ongoing support—so clients can optimise performance, enhance safety, and achieve
            measurable returns on investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Fabrication Workshop is at the core of our capabilities. It provides laser and plasma
            profiling, vessel and tank manufacturing, precision machining, custom design, heat treatment
            (both on-site and oven-based), rolling, and bending. By combining these advanced fabrication
            services with our expertise in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), data analytics, and
            instrumentation and control systems, we help organisations address today's most complex
            operational challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Phakathi Solutions is at the forefront of deploying Artificial Intelligence at the
            edge, allowing data to be processed directly where it is generated. This approach reduces
            latency, ensures greater reliability, and provides real-time insights for faster decision-making
            and predictive maintenance. Whether optimising fabrication workflows or enhancing on-site
            safety, edge-focused AI empowers our clients to remain agile while harnessing the power of
            industrial data.
